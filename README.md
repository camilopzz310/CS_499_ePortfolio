# CS_499_ePortfolio

# Professional Self-Assessment

Hello! My name is Camila. As I conclude the Computer Science program, this self-assessment introduces my ePortfolio showcasing my coursework throughout the program. Developing this ePortfolio has helped me showcase my strengths, shaped my professional goals and values, and has prepared me to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.

One of the pivotal courses that has contributed significantly to my skill set was the Mobile Architecture and Technologies class. I learned a lot about coding and was able to create an application that implemented code and designing a user interface. It has sharpened my problem-solving skills and grew my joy in coding. The computational Graphics and Visualization course expanded my understanding in computer science by realizing what different things coding can do when I worked on my project of creating a camera model.

In the field of computer science, collaboration in a team environment, communication with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database, and security are some skills vital to know and learn. Collaboration is essential in a team environment in order to provide a successful product which can continue be improved upon by the whole team. Communicating with stakeholders is crucial to meet their expectations through providing detailed requirements, being up to date with any changes, and feedback. Data structures and algorithms provide a foundation in writing effective and efficient code through the knowledge of different data structures and finding which one is best suited. Software engineering and database helps one know the development lifecycle from planning to designing then deploying and maintaining the software. One also learns how to create databases and be able to retrieve, add, delete, or edit information. Security is vital nowadays and to prevent any harm to the company or product several security factors are used to protect information.

My skills in collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, understanding data structures and algorithms, applying software engineering principles, and ensuring security lets me deliver high-quality software solutions. My artifact for software engineering is an event planning application created for my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Technologies. The enhancement chosen for this artifact is reverse engineering a piece of software for a different operating system which in this case was from a mobile operating system to a windows operating system. My artifact for Algorithms and Data Structures is a program that prints a list of all the Computer Science courses in alphanumerical order and for a given course prints out the title and prerequisites. This artifact originates from my work for CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design and the enhancement that will be done on this artifact is improving its efficiency. Finally my artifact for Databases is a client/server application in which the client-side code interfaces with databases. This artifact originates from my work in CS 340: Client/Server Development. The company Grazioso Salvare is seeking a software application that can work with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. The enhancement done for this software is incorporating data mining. Through these different enhancement I hope it demonstrates my full range abilities in Computer Science.

  - Once registered/logged in it leads the user to the Event Tracker page. The top function allows the user to add an event by inserting the event details then selecting the Add Event button.
  - Below shows the Upcoming Events table. 
  - If you select the “X” on the left side of a specific event it will delete the event. 
  - If you wish to edit an event you click once on the box you want to edit and change the description.

### Narrative
The artifact I chose is an event planning application created for my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Technologies that I took last term. The purpose of the application is to track the dates and times of upcoming events. The application was designed and coded using Android studio. The requirements include: a database with at least two tables, one to store the event details and one to store user logins and passwords, a screen for logging into the app it should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before, a screen, with a grid, that displays all upcoming events, a mechanism by which the user can add and remove events from the database, a mechanism by which the user can enter the time and general information of a specific event, and a mechanism by which the application will notify the user on the day that an event has been scheduled. This app is meant to address users' needs in terms of having an application to remind them when there is an upcoming event. I selected this item because it was done on a different operating system than what I have used and it considered the design and operation of the application. The specific component that showcase my abilities in software development is the layout of the application and the database design. The enhancement chosen for this artifact is reverse engineering a piece of software for a different operating system which was a Windows Operating System. I have met most of the course objectives from my plan of enhancement in Module One but I would say I can improve on the security a bit more in terms of input validation. So far I don’t have any updates to my outcome-coverage plan. 
I learned a few things upon creating and improving the artifact chose. I used another artifact, the animal rescue dashboard (artifact three), as an example of how I can develop the user interface in a windows operating system. I learned more about how to create the layout and instead of having the functions in a separate file I had the functions in the same file. I did research and learned more about databases. I faced several challenges such as being able to add, delete, and edit an event on the user interface and updating it on the database. I wasn’t able to make it past the login page but the error I had was because of my methods of editing and deleting which I will be fixing.

**Enhancements**:
- **Reverse Engineer**: Reverse engineer the software for a different operating system. Mobile operating system to windows operating system.
- **Security Improvements**: Implemented user authentication.

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Database management
- Security best practices - user authentication
- User interface design
- Reverse engineering

### Narrative
The artifact I selected for Algorithms and Data Structures is a program that prints a list of all the Computer Science courses in alphanumerical order and for a given course prints out the title and prerequisites. This artifact originates from my work for CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design that I took about two terms ago. I selected this artifact in order to use investigate which data structure (vector, hash table, and tree) is best suited to solve this problem. Data structures are important to understand because by knowing which data structure performs better. The enhancement that will be done on this artifact is improving the efficiency, by changing the data structure to hashtables. Efficiently searching through the data structure showcases my skills of designing, developing, and delivering a professional well structured program which follows the course outcome: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. Documenting the process and providing rationale to the approach also provides an understanding of the data structure and goes along with the course outcome: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. In addition, by translating the flowchart into code aligns with the course outcome: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. The improvements that I did with this artifact is change the data structure by instead of using vectors to using hashtables which is more efficient. In each function I changed the use of searching through a vector to having it search through a hash table, unordered_map. I used Visual Studio to run my program and opened it as ProjectTwo.sln. When running the program you must first load the data structure and it asks for which file you want to use and you input ABCU_Advising_Program_Input.txt. The ABCU_Advising_Program_Input.txt should be in the folder CS 300 Project Two Final. The txt file lists the course number, course title, and its prerequisites in the same line. Once the file is loaded you have the option to use option 2 and 3 and it also gives you an option to exit. I have additional updates for my outcome-coverage plan by adding more to the txt file since at the moment it only has a small list and I am planning on researching of other ways to improve the efficiency. Improving the enhancement of the artifact, I learned about how hash tables are used. Hashtables are ideal when you need a data structure for fast key-based access which is in this scenario. There is a challenge that I faced, which was not knowing why when I loaded the data structure and printed the course list there were symbols in front of  “MATH201”. This is something that I will look into.


**Enhancements**:
- **Improve Efficiency**: Improve efficiency by changing data structures specifically from vector to hash table.

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Design, develop, and deliver by ability to analyze algorithms and data structures for efficiency
- Analysis

### Narrative
The artifact I selected for Algorithms and Data Structures is a client/server application in which the client-side code interfaces with databases. This artifact originates from my work in CS 340: Client/Server Development. Grazioso Salvare is seeking a software application that can work with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. Global Rain has contracted for a full stack development of this application, including a database and a client-facing web application dashboard through which users at Grazioso Salvare will access the database. A database and a Python module enabling CRUD functionality for MongoDB, the dashboard and the database interface logic has been developed. This will include dashboard attributes. The dashboard must be a user-friendly, intuitive interface that will reduce user errors and training time. I selected this artifact to investigate how I can improve on data mining. Data mining is going through large sets of data such as the animal shelters to find relevant information that can be used for a specific purpose which is suited animals to serve in rescue. Specific components that showcases my data mining skills is modeling to categorize the animal data in a chart to have a visual representation and enhancing the original code by adding more filters on the dashboard. The enhancement that will be done on this artifact is incorporating data mining. To incorporate data mining, first I will examine the current code and find ways to improve it. A technique to add is data clustering. This will group certain animals based on their type, breed, etc. The dashboard can then be enhanced to make it more interactive and filter data based on the options chosen. Adding additional filtering options apart from the type of rescue can be more helpful as well. Such as specifically finding a specific breed of dog to do water rescue. Or maybe even adding a search bar to look for a specific name. This will make the selection even easier and more efficient. With this enhancement I believe I did meet the course objectives of: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts; Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices; and Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.  Some updates to my outcome coverage plan is fixing the rest of the radio buttons. Originally the program functions didn’ work and just displayed all the animals, but now more filter options are available. I learned a lot in enhancing and modifying the product in terms of features I can use to enhance a user interface. I did have many challenges I had to overcome. The main one being I did not have the linux shell installed in order to access the MongoDB from my original code so I had to improvise and just have the code directly access the csv file of the list of animals from the animal shelters. I also had trouble having the radio buttons work to update the dashboard according to the selection.

**Enhancements**:
- **Data Mining**: Incorporate Data Mining through the use of filters and charts. 

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- User interface design
- Analysis
- Modeling
