# Professional Self-Assessment

Hello! My name is Camila. As I conclude the Computer Science program, this self assessment introduces my ePortfolio showcasing Completing my coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped me showcase my strengths, shaped my professional goals and values, and has prepared me to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.

One of the pivotal courses that has contributed significantly to my skill set was Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms. I learned about different data structures and the pros and cons of using it. It has also sharpened my problem-solving skills. One of the artifacts I chose was to create a program that prints and searches through a list of courses using a vector data structure and I improved it by using a hash table data structure to make it work more efficiently. 

In the field of computer science, collaboration in a team environment, communication with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database, and security are some skills vital to know and learn. Collaboration is essential in a team environment in order to provide a successful product which can continue be improved upon by the whole team. Communicating with stakeholders is crucial to meet their expectations through providing detailed requirements, being up to date with any changes, and feedback. Data structures and algorithms provide a foundation in writing effective and efficient code through the knowledge of different data structures and finding which one is best suited. Software engineering and database helps one know the development lifecycle from planning to designing then deploying and maintaining the software. One also learns how to create databases and be able to retrieve, add, delete, or edit information. Security is vital nowadays and to prevent any harm to the company or product several security factors are used to protect information.

My skills in collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, understanding data structures and algorithms, applying software engineering principles, and ensuring security lets me deliver high-quality software solutions. My artifact for software engineering is an event planning application created for my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Technologies. The enhancement chosen for this artifact is reverse engineering a piece of software for a different operating system which in this case was from a mobile operating system to a windows operating system. My artifact for Algorithms and Data Structures is a program that prints a list of all the Computer Science courses in alphanumerical order and for a given course prints out the title and prerequisites. This artifact originates from my work for CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design and the enhancement that will be done on this artifact is improving its efficiency. Finally my artifact for Databases is a client/server application in which the client-side code interfaces with databases. This artifact originates from my work in CS 340: Client/Server Development. The company Grazioso Salvare is seeking a software application that can work with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. The enhancement done for this software is incorporating data mining. Through these different enhancement I hope it demonstrates my full range abilities in Computer Science.
